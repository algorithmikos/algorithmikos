👋 **Hi, I’m Umar from the misty Lands!** 🌫️

I am a Web Developer with a passion for React.js and a preference for writing code that doesn’t haunt me later. That is why I stick with TypeScript—it’s logical, practical, and frankly, a developer's best friend when JavaScript decides to channel your worst nightmares.

Currently, I’m working on [Conquer](https://conquer-matrix.web.app/), a powerful personal task management app designed to keep you (and me) organised, and [Teryaq](https://teryaq.pages.dev/), a companion app crafted specifically for Type 1 diabetes patients.

- 👀 I’m interested in building user-centric web and mobile apps and creative solutions for unique challenges.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Laravel (yes, I’ve joined the PHP world) and exploring advanced backend solutions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects, especially in React, TypeScript, or applications that make life easier while being enjoyable to create.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Telegram](https://t.me/algorithmikos) would be the best way to get in touch.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once ran a vibrant educational hub *and* dealt with vBulletin fora—proof that I thrive in chaos.
